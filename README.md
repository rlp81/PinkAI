# PinkAI
PinkAI was created by rlp81.

It was created for a friend named "Pink" or "Pinky" hence the name. If you do use this code, I would enjoy credit, but otherwise have fun and a good learning experience!

If you have any questions you can contact me via discord: Coal#3591 Please state that you're there for support otherwise within a few days I will ignore your request.
